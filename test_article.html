Abduction: The General Idea</a><p>\n\nAbduction or, as it is also often called, Inference to the Best \nExplanation is a type of inference that assigns special status to \nexplanatory considerations. Most philosophers agree that this type of\ninference is frequently employed, in some form or other, both in \neveryday and in scientific reasoning. However, the exact form as well\nas the normative status of abduction are still matters of \ncontroversy. This entry contrasts abduction with other types of \ninference; points at prominent uses of it, both in and outside \nphilosophy; considers various more or less precise statements of it; \ndiscusses its normative status; and highlights possible connections \nbetween abduction and Bayesian confirmation theory. </p><em>First published Wed Mar 9, 2011</em><div id=\"main-text\">\n\n<h2><a name=\"AbdGenIde\">1. Abduction: The General Idea</a></h2>\n\n<p>\n\nYou happen to know that Tim and Harry have recently had a terrible \nrow that ended their friendship. Now someone tells you that she just \nsaw Tim and Harry jogging together. The best explanation for this \nthat you can think of is that they made up. You conclude that they \nare friends again. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nOne morning you enter the kitchen to find a plate and cup on the \ntable, with breadcrumbs and a pat of butter on it, and surrounded by \na jar of jam, a pack of sugar, and an empty carton of milk. You \nconclude that one of your house-mates got up at night to make him- or\nherself a midnight snack and was too tired to clear the table. This, \nyou think, best explains the scene you are facing. To be sure, it \nmight be that someone burgled the house and took the time to have a \nbite while on the job, or a house-mate might have arranged the things\non the table without having a midnight snack but just to make you \nbelieve that someone had a midnight snack. But these hypotheses \nstrike you as providing much more contrived explanations of the data \nthan the one you infer to. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nWalking along the beach, you see what looks like a picture of Winston\nChurchill in the sand. It could be that, as in the opening pages of \nHilary Putnam's (1981), what you see is actually the trace of \nan ant crawling on the beach. The much simpler, and therefore (you \nthink) much better, explanation is that someone intentionally drew a \npicture of Churchill in the sand. That, in any case, is what you come\naway believing. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn these examples, the conclusions do not follow logically from the \npremises. For instance, it does not follow logically that Tim and \nHarry are friends again from the premises that they had a terrible \nrow which ended their friendship and that they have just been seen \njogging together; it does not even follow, we may suppose, from all \nthe information you have about Tim and Harry. Nor do you have any \nuseful statistical data about friendships, terrible rows, and joggers\nthat might warrant an inference from the information that you have \nabout Tim and Harry to the conclusion that they are friends again, or\neven to the conclusion that, probably (or with a certain \nprobability), they are friends again. What leads you to the \nconclusion, and what according to a considerable number of \nphilosophers may also warrant this conclusion, is precisely the fact \nthat Tim and Harry's being friends again would, if true, \n<em>best</em> <em>explain</em> the fact that they have just been seen\njogging together. (The proviso that a hypothesis be true if it is to \nexplain anything is taken as read from here on.) Similar remarks \napply to the other two examples. The type of inference exhibited here\nis called <em>abduction</em> or, somewhat more commonly nowadays, \n<em>Inference to the Best</em> <em>Explanation</em>. </p>\n\n<h3><a name=\"DedIndAbd\">1.1 Deduction, induction, abduction</a></h3>\n\n<p>\n\nAbduction is normally thought of as being one of three major types of\ninference, the other two being deduction and induction. The \ndistinction between deduction, on the one hand, and induction and \nabduction, on the other hand, corresponds to the distinction between \nnecessary and non-necessary inferences. In deductive inferences, what\nis inferred is <em>necessarily</em> true if the premises from which \nit is inferred are true; that is, the truth of the premises \n<em>guarantees</em> the truth of the conclusion. A familiar type of \nexample is inferences instantiating the schema </p>\n\n<blockquote>\nAll <i>A</i>s are <i>B</i>s.<br />\n<i>a</i> is an <i>A</i>.<br />\nHence, <i>a</i> is a <i>B</i>.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\nBut not all inferences are of this variety. Consider, for instance, \nthe inference of “John is rich” from “John lives in\nChelsea” and “Most people living in Chelsea are \nrich.” Here, the truth of the first sentence is not guaranteed \n(but only made likely) by the joint truth of the second and third \nsentences. Differently put, it is not necessarily the case that if \nthe premises are true, then so is the conclusion: it is logically \ncompatible with the truth of the premises that John is a member of \nthe minority of non-rich inhabitants of Chelsea. The case is similar \nregarding your inference to the conclusion that Tim and Harry are \nfriends again on the basis of the information that they have been \nseen jogging together. Perhaps Tim and Harry are former business \npartners who still had some financial matters to discuss, however \nmuch they would have liked to avoid this, and decided to combine this\nwith their daily exercise; this is compatible with their being firmly\ndecided never to make up. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nSince Charles Sanders Peirce, it is standard practice to group \nnon-necessary inferences into <em>inductive</em> and <em>abductive \n</em>ones—see the</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<a href=\"peirce.html\">Supplement: Peirce on Abduction</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\nInductive inferences form a somewhat heterogeneous class, but for\npresent purposes they may be characterized as those inferences that\nare based purely on statistical data, such as observed frequencies of\noccurrences of a particular feature in a given population. An example\nof such an inference would be this: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n96 per cent of the Flemish college students speak both Dutch and French.<br />\nLouise is a Flemish college student.<br />\nHence, Louise speaks both Dutch and French.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\nHowever, the relevant statistical information may also be more \nvaguely given, as in the premise, “Most people living in \nChelsea are rich.” (There is much discussion about whether the \nconclusion of an inductive argument can be stated in purely \nqualitative terms or whether it should be a quantitative \none—for instance, that it holds with a probability of .96 that \nLouise speaks both Dutch and French—or whether it can \n<em>sometimes</em> be stated in qualitative terms—for instance,\nif the probability that it is true is high enough—and sometimes\nnot. On these and other issues related to induction, see Kyburg\n1990 (Ch. 4). It should also be mentioned that Harman (1965) conceives\ninduction as a special type of abduction.) </p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe mere fact that an inference is based on statistical data is not \nenough to classify it as an inductive one. You may have observed many\ngray elephants and no non-gray ones, and infer from this that all \nelephants are gray, <em>because that would</em> <em>provide the best \nexplanation for why you have observed so many gray elephants</em> \n<em>and no non-gray ones</em>. This would be an instance of an \nabductive inference. It suggests that the best way to distinguish \nbetween induction and abduction is this: both are \n<em>ampliative</em>, meaning that the conclusion goes beyond what is \n(logically) contained in the premises (which is why they are \nnon-necessary inferences), but in abduction there is an implicit or \nexplicit appeal to explanatory considerations, whereas in induction \nthere is not; in induction, there is <em>only</em> an appeal to \nobserved frequencies or statistics. (I emphasize “only,” \nbecause in abduction there may also be an appeal to frequencies or \nstatistics, as the example about the elephants exhibits.) </p>\n\n<p>\n\nA noteworthy feature of abduction, which it shares with induction but\nnot with deduction, is that it violates <em>monotonicity</em>, \nmeaning that it may be possible to infer abductively certain \nconclusions from a <em>subset</em> of a set <i>S</i> of premises \nwhich cannot be inferred abductively from <i>S</i> as a whole. For \ninstance, adding the premise that Tim and Harry are former business \npartners who still have some financial matters to discuss, to the \npremises that they had a terrible row some time ago and that they \nwere just seen jogging together may no longer warrant you to infer \nthat they are friends again, even if—let us suppose—the \nlast two premises alone do warrant that inference. The reason is that\nwhat counts as the best explanation of Tim and Harry's jogging \ntogether in light of the original premises may no longer do so once \nthe information has been added that they are former business partners\nwith financial matters to discuss. </p>\n\n<h3><a name=\"UbiAbd\">1.2 The ubiquity of abduction</a></h3>\n\n<p>\n\nThe type of inference exemplified in the cases described at the \nbeginning of this entry will strike most as entirely familiar. \nPhilosophers as well as psychologists tend to agree that abduction is\nfrequently employed in everyday reasoning. Sometimes our reliance on \nabductive reasoning is quite obvious and explicit. But in some daily \npractices, it may be so routine and automatic that it easily goes \nunnoticed. A case in point may be our trust in other people's \ntestimony, which has been said to rest on abductive reasoning; see \nHarman 1965, Adler 1994, Fricker 1994, and Lipton 1998 for \ndefenses of this claim. For instance, according to Jonathan Adler \n(1994, 274f), “[t]he best explanation for why the informant \nasserts that <i>P</i> is normally that … he believes it for \nduly responsible reasons and … he intends that I shall believe\nit too,” which is why we are normally justified in trusting the\ninformant's testimony. This may well be correct, even though in\ncoming to trust a person's testimony one does not normally seem\nto be aware of any abductive reasoning going on in one's mind. \nSimilar remarks may apply to what some hold to be a further, possibly\neven more fundamental, role of abduction in linguistic practice, to \nwit, its role in determining what a speaker means by an utterance. \nSpecifically, it has been argued that decoding utterances is a matter\nof inferring the best explanation of why someone said what he or she \nsaid in the context in which the utterance was made. Even more \nspecifically, authors working in the field of pragmatics have \nsuggested that hearers invoke the Gricean maxims of conversation to \nhelp them work out the best explanation of a speaker's \nutterance whenever the semantic content of the utterance is \ninsufficiently informative for the purposes of the conversation, or \nis too informative, or off-topic, or implausible, or otherwise odd or\ninappropriate; see, for instance, Bach and Harnish 1979 (92f), \nDascal 1979 (167), and Hobbs 2004. As in cases of reliance on \nspeaker testimony, the requisite abductive reasoning would normally \nseem to take place at a subconscious level. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nAbductive reasoning is not limited to everyday contexts. Quite the\ncontrary: philosophers of science have argued that abduction is a\ncornerstone of scientific methodology; see, for instance, Boyd 1981,\n1984, Harré 1986, 1988, Lipton 1991, 2004, and Psillos\n1999. Ernan McMullin (1992) even goes so far as to call abduction\n“the inference that makes science.” To illustrate the use\nof abduction in science, we consider two examples.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was discovered that \nthe orbit of Uranus, one of the seven planets known at the time, \ndeparted from the orbit as predicted on the basis of Isaac \nNewton's theory of universal gravitation and the auxiliary \nassumption that there were no further planets in the solar system. \nOne possible explanation was, of course, that Newton's theory \nis false. Given its great empirical successes for (then) more than \ntwo centuries, that did not appear to be a very good explanation. Two\nastronomers, John Couch Adams and Urbain Leverrier, instead suggested\n(independently of each other but almost simultaneously) that there \nwas an eighth, as yet undiscovered planet in the solar system; that, \nthey thought, provided the best explanation of Uranus' \ndeviating orbit. Not much later, this planet, which is now known as \n“Neptune,” was discovered. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe second example concerns what is now commonly regarded to have \nbeen the discovery of the electron by the English physicist Joseph \nJohn Thomson. Thomson had conducted experiments on cathode rays in \norder to determine whether they are streams of charged particles. He \nconcluded that they are indeed, reasoning as follows: </p>\n\n<blockquote> <p>\n\nAs the cathode rays carry a charge of negative electricity, are \ndeflected by an electrostatic force as if they were negatively \nelectrified, and are acted on by a magnetic force in just the way in \nwhich this force would act on a negatively electrified body moving \nalong the path of these rays, I can see no escape from the conclusion\nthat they are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of\nmatter. (Thomson, cited in Achinstein 2001, 17)</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\nThe conclusion that cathode rays consist of negatively charged \nparticles does not follow logically from the reported experimental \nresults, nor could Thomson draw on any relevant statistical data. \nThat nevertheless he could “see no escape from the \nconclusion” is, we may safely assume, because the conclusion is\nthe best—in this case presumably even the only \nplausible—explanation of his results that he could think of. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nMany other examples of scientific uses of abduction have been\ndiscussed in the literature; see, for instance, Harré 1986,\n1988 and Lipton 1991, 2004. Abduction is also said to be the\npredominant mode of reasoning in medical diagnosis: physicians tend to\ngo for the hypothesis that best explains the patient's symptoms (see\nJosephson and Josephson (eds.) 1994, 9–12). </p>\n\n<p>\n\nLast but not least, abduction plays a central role in some important \nphilosophical debates. Arguably, its most notable role is in \nobjections to so-called underdetermination arguments. \nUnderdetermination arguments generally start from the premise that a \nnumber of given hypotheses are empirically equivalent, which their \nauthors take to mean that the evidence—indeed, any evidence we \nmight ever come to possess—is unable to favor one of them over \nthe others. From this, we are supposed to conclude that one can never be \nwarranted in believing any particular one of the hypotheses. (This is\nrough, but it will do for present purposes; see Douven 2008, and \nStanford 2009, for more detailed accounts of underdetermination \narguments.) A famous instance of this type of argument is the \nCartesian argument for global skepticism, according to which the \nhypothesis that reality is more or less the way we customarily deem \nit to be is empirically equivalent to a variety of so-called \nskeptical hypotheses (such as that we are beguiled by an evil demon, \nor that we are brains in a vat, connected to a supercomputer). \nSimilar arguments have been given in support of scientific \nantirealism, according to which it will never be warranted for us to \nchoose between empirically equivalent rivals concerning what \nunderlies the observable part of reality. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nResponses to these arguments typically point to the fact that the \nnotion of empirical equivalence at play unduly neglects explanatory \nconsiderations, for instance, by defining the notion strictly in \nterms of hypotheses' making the same predictions. Those \nresponding then argue that even if some hypotheses make exactly the \nsame predictions, one of them may still be a better explanation of \nthe phenomena predicted. Thus, if explanatory considerations have a \nrole in determining which inferences we are licensed to make—as\naccording to defenders of abduction they have—then we might \nstill be warranted in believing in the truth (or probable truth, or \nsome such, depending—as will be seen below—on the version\nof abduction one assumes) of one of a number of hypotheses that all \nmake the same predictions. Following Bertrand Russell (1912, Ch. 2), \nmany epistemologists have invoked abduction in arguing against \nCartesian skepticism, their key claim being that even though, by \nconstruction, the skeptical hypotheses make the same predictions as \nthe hypothesis that reality is more or less the way we ordinarily \ntake it to be, they are not equally good explanations of what they \npredict; in particular, the skeptical hypotheses have been said to be\nconsiderably less simple than the “ordinary world” \nhypothesis; see, among many others, Harman 1973 (Chs. 8 and 11), \nGoldman 1988 (205), Moser 1989 (161), and Vogel 1990, 2005. \nSimilarly, philosophers of science have argued that we are warranted \nto believe in Special Relativity Theory as opposed to Lorentz's \nversion of the æther theory. For even though these theories \nmake the same predictions, the former is explanatorily superior to \nthe latter. (Most arguments that have been given for this claim come \ndown to the contention that Special Relativity Theory is \nontologically more parsimonious than its competitor, which postulates\nthe existence of an æther. See Janssen 2002 for an excellent \ndiscussion of the various reasons philosophers of science have \nadduced for preferring Einstein's theory to Lorentz's.) </p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"ExpAbd\">2. Explicating Abduction</a></h2>\n\n<p>\n\nPrecise statements of what abduction amounts to are rare in the \nliterature on abduction. (Peirce did propose an at least fairly \nprecise statement; but, as explained in the supplement to this entry,\nit does not capture what most nowadays understand by abduction.) Its \ncore idea is often said to be that explanatory considerations have \nconfirmation-theoretic import, or that explanatory success is a (not \nnecessarily unfailing) mark of truth. Clearly, however, these \nformulations are slogans at best, and it takes little effort to see \nthat they can be cashed out in a great variety of prima facie \nplausible ways. Here we will consider a number of such possible \nexplications, starting with what one might term the “textbook \nversion of abduction,” which, as will be seen, is manifestly \ndefective, and then going on to consider various possible refinements\nof it. What those versions have in \ncommon—unsurprisingly—is that they are all inference \nrules, requiring premises encompassing explanatory considerations and\nyielding a conclusion that makes some statement about the truth of a \nhypothesis. The differences concern the premises that are required, \nor what exactly we are allowed to infer from them (or both). </p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn textbooks on epistemology or the philosophy of science, one often \nencounters something like the following as a formulation of \nabduction: </p>\n\n<dl class=\"hang\">\n<dt>ABD1</dt><dd>\n\nGiven evidence <i>E</i> and candidate\nexplanations <i>H</i><sub>1</sub>,…, <i>H</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>\nof <i>E</i>, infer the truth\nof <em>that</em> <i>H</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> which best\nexplains <i>E</i>.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>\n\nAn observation that is frequently made about this rule, and that\npoints to a potential problem for it, is that it presupposes the\nnotions of candidate explanation and best explanation, neither of\nwhich has a straightforward interpretation. While some still hope that\nthe former can be spelled out in purely logical, or at least purely\nformal, terms, it is often said that the latter must appeal to the\nso-called theoretical virtues, like simplicity, generality, and\ncoherence with well-established theories; the best explanation would\nthen be the hypothesis which, on balance, does best with respect to\nthese virtues. (See, for instance, Thagard 1978 and McMullin 1996.)\nThe problem is that none of the said virtues is presently particularly\nwell understood. (Giere, in Callebaut (ed.) 1993 (232), even makes the\nradical claim that the theoretical virtues lack real content and play\nno more than a rhetorical role in science. In view of recent formal\nwork both on simplicity and on coherence—for instance, Forster\nand Sober 1994, and Li and Vitanyi 1997, on simplicity and Bovens\nand Hartmann 2003, on coherence—the first part of this claim\nhas become hard to maintain. Psychological evidence casts doubt on the\nsecond part of the claim; see, for instance, Lombrozo 2007, on the\nrole of simplicity in people's assessments of explanatory goodness and\nKoslowski <em>et al</em>. 2008, on the role of coherence with background\nknowledge in those assessments.) </p>\n\n<p>\n\nFurthermore, many of those who think ABD1 is headed along the right \nlines believe that it is too strong. Some think that abduction \nwarrants an inference only to the <em>probable</em> truth of the best\nexplanation, others that it warrants an inference only to the \n<em>approximate</em> truth of the best explanation, and still others \nthat it warrants an inference only to the <em>probable</em> \n<em>approximate</em> truth. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe real problem with ABD1 runs deeper than this, however. Because \nabduction is ampliative—as explained earlier—it will not \nbe a sound rule of inference in the strict logical sense, however \nabduction is explicated exactly. It can still be <em>reliable</em>\nin that it mostly leads to a true conclusion whenever the \npremises are true. An obvious necessary condition for ABD1 to be \nreliable in this sense is that, <em>mostly</em>, when it is true that\n<i>H</i> best explains <i>E</i>, and <i>E</i> is true, then <i>H</i> \nis true as well (or <i>H</i> is approximately true, or probably true,\nor probably approximately true). But this would not be \n<em>enough</em> for ABD1 to be reliable. For ABD1 takes as its \npremise only that some hypothesis is the best explanation of the \nevidence <em>as compared to other hypotheses in a</em> <em>given \nset</em>. Thus, if the rule is to be reliable, it must hold that, at \nleast typically, the best explanation relative to the set of \nhypotheses that we consider would also come out as being best in \ncomparison with any other hypotheses that we might have conceived \n(but for lack of time or ingenuity, or for some other reason, did not\nconceive). In other words, it must hold that at least typically the \n<em>absolutely</em> best explanation of the evidence is to be found \namong the candidate explanations we have come up with, for else ABD1 \nmay well lead us to believe “the best of a bad lot” (van \nFraassen 1989, 143). </p>\n\n<p>\n\nHow reasonable is it to suppose that this extra requirement is \nusually fulfilled? Not at all, presumably. To believe otherwise, we \nmust assume some sort of privilege on our part to the effect that \nwhen we consider possible explanations of the data, we are somehow \npredisposed to hit, inter alia, upon the absolutely best explanation \nof those data. After all, hardly ever will we have considered, or \nwill it even be possible to consider, <em>all</em> potential \nexplanations. As van Fraassen (1989, 144) points out, it is <em>a \npriori</em> rather implausible to hold that we are thus privileged. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn response to this, one might argue that the challenge to show that \nthe best explanation is always or mostly among the hypotheses \nconsidered can be met without having to assume some form of \nprivilege. For given the hypotheses we have managed to come up with, \nwe can always generate a set of hypotheses which jointly exhaust \nlogical space. Suppose \n<i>H</i><sub>1</sub>,…,<i>H</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> \nare the candidate explanations we have so far been able to conceive. \nThen simply define <i>H</i><sub>n+1</sub> := \n¬<i>H</i><sub>1</sub> ∧⋯∧\n¬<i>H</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> and add this new hypothesis \nas a further candidate explanation to the ones we already have. \nObviously, the set \n{<i>H</i><sub>1</sub>,…,<i>H</i><sub>n+1</sub>} is \nexhaustive, in that one of its elements must be true. Following this \nin itself simple procedure would seem enough to make sure that we \nnever miss out on the absolutely best explanation. (See Lipton 1993,\nfor a proposal along these lines.) </p>\n\n<p>\n\nAlas, there is a catch. For even though there may be many hypotheses \n<i>H</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> that imply <i>H</i><sub>n+1</sub> and, \nhad they been formulated, would have been evaluated as being a better\nexplanation for the data than the best explanation among the \ncandidate explanations we started out with, <i>H</i><sub>n+1</sub> \nitself will in general be hardly informative; in fact, in general it \nwill not even be clear what its empirical consequences are. Suppose, \nfor instance, we have as competing explanations Special Relativity \nTheory and Lorentz's version of the æther theory. Then, \nfollowing the above proposal, we may add to our candidate \nexplanations that neither of these two theories is true. But surely \nthis further hypothesis will be ranked quite low <em>qua</em> \nexplanation—if it will be ranked at all, which seems doubtful, \ngiven that it is wholly unclear what its empirical consequences are. \nThis is not to say that the suggested procedure may never work. The \npoint is that in general it will give little assurance that the best \nexplanation is among the candidate explanations we consider. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nA more promising response to the above “argument of the bad \nlot” begins with the observation that the argument capitalizes \non a peculiar asymmetry or incongruence in ABD1. The rule gives \nlicense to an absolute conclusion—that a given hypothesis is \ntrue—on the basis of a comparative premise, namely, that that \nparticular hypothesis is the best explanation of the evidence \nrelative to the other hypotheses available (see Kuipers 2000, 171). \nThis incongruence is not avoided by replacing “truth” \nwith “probable truth” or “approximate truth.”\nIn order to avoid it, one has two general options. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe first option is to modify the rule so as to have it require an \nabsolute premise. For instance, following Alan Musgrave (1988) or \nPeter Lipton (1993), one may require the hypothesis whose truth is \ninferred to be not only the best of the available potential \nexplanations, but also to be <em>satisfactory</em> (Musgrave) or \n<em>good enough</em> (Lipton), yielding the following variant of \nABD1: </p>\n\n<dl class=\"hang\">\n\n<dt>ABD2</dt>\n<dd>Given evidence <i>E</i> and candidate explanations\n<i>H</i><sub>1</sub>,…, <i>H</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> of\n<i>E</i>, infer the truth of <em>that \n</em><i>H</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> which explains <i>E</i> best, \nprovided <i>H</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> is satisfactory/good enough \n<em>qua</em> explanation.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>\n\nNeedless to say, ABD2 needs supplementing by a criterion for the \nsatisfactoriness of explanations, or their being good enough, which, \nhowever, we are still lacking. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nSecondly, one can formulate a symmetric or congruous version of \nabduction by having it sanction, given a comparative premise, only a \ncomparative conclusion; this option, too, can in turn be realized in \nmore than one way. Here is one way to do it, which has been proposed \nand defended in the work of Theo Kuipers (e.g., Kuipers 1984, 1992, \n2000). </p>\n\n<dl class=\"hang\">\n\n<dt>ABD3</dt>\n<dd>Given evidence <i>E</i> and candidate explanations\n<i>H</i><sub>1</sub>,…, <i>H</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> of\n<i>E</i>, if <i>H</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> explains <i>E</i> better \nthan any of the other hypotheses, infer that \n<i>H</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> is closer to the truth than any of the \nother hypotheses.</dd>\n\n</dl>\n\n<p>\n\nClearly, ABD3 requires an account of closeness to the truth, but many\nsuch accounts are on offer today. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nOne noteworthy feature of the congruous versions of abduction \nconsidered here is that they do not rely on the assumption of an \nimplausible privilege on the reasoner's part that, we saw, ABD1\nimplicitly relies on. Another is that if one can be certain that, \nhowever many candidate explanations for the data one may have missed,\nnone equals the best of those one <em>has</em> thought of, then the \ncongruous versions license exactly the same inference as ABD1 does \n(supposing that one would not be certain that no potential \nexplanation is as good as the best explanation one has thought of if \nthe latter is not even satisfactory or sufficiently good). </p>\n\n<p>\n\nAs mentioned, there is widespread agreement that people frequently \nrely on abductive reasoning. Which of the above rules <em>exactly</em>\nis it that people rely on? Or might it be still some further \nrule that they rely on? Or might they in some contexts rely on one \nversion, and in others on another? Philosophical argumentation is \nunable to answer these questions. And while experimental \npsychologists have started paying attention to the role humans give \nto explanatory considerations in reasoning, so far there is nothing \nto be found in the literature that gives any indication as to what \nthe answers should be. With respect to the normative question of \nwhich of the above rules we <em>ought</em> to rely on (if we ought to\nrely on any form of abduction), where philosophical argumentation \nshould be able to help, the situation is hardly any better. In view \nof the argument of the bad lot, ABD1 does not look very good. Other \narguments against abduction are claimed to be independent of the \nexact explication of the rule; below, these arguments will be found \nwanting. On the other hand, arguments that have been given in favor \nof abduction—some of which will also be discussed \nbelow—do not discern between specific versions. So, supposing \npeople do indeed commonly rely on abduction, it must be considered an\nopen question as to which version(s) of abduction they rely on. \nEqually, supposing it is rational for people to rely on abduction, it\nmust be considered an open question as to which version, or perhaps \nversions, of abduction they ought to, or are at least permitted to, \nrely on. </p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"StaAbd\">3. The Status of Abduction</a></h2>\n\n<p>\n\nEven if it is true that we routinely rely on abductive reasoning, it \nmay still be asked whether this practice is rational. For instance, \nexperimental studies have shown that when people are able to think of\nan explanation for some possible event, they tend to overestimate the\nlikelihood that this event will actually occur. (See Koehler 1991, \nfor a survey of some of these studies; see also Brem and Rips 2000.)\nMore telling still, Tania Lombrozo (2007) shows that, in some \nsituations, people tend to grossly overrate the probability of \nsimpler explanations compared to more complicated ones. Although \nthese studies are not directly concerned with abduction in any of the\nforms discussed so far, they nevertheless suggest that taking into \naccount explanatory considerations in one's reasoning may not \nalways be for the better. (It is to be noted that Lombrozo's \nexperiments <em>are</em> directly concerned with some proposals that \nhave been made for explicating abduction in a Bayesian framework; see\nSection 4.) However, the most pertinent remarks about the normative \nstatus of abduction are so far to be found in the philosophical \nliterature. This section discusses the main criticisms that have been\nlevelled against abduction, as well as the strongest arguments that \nhave been given in its defense. </p>\n\n<h3><a name=\"Cri\">3.1 Criticisms</a></h3>\n\n<p>\n\nWe have already encountered the so-called argument of the bad lot, \nwhich, we saw, is valid as a criticism of ABD1 but powerless against \nvarious (what we called) congruous rules of abduction. We here \nconsider two objections that are meant to be more general. The first \neven purports to challenge the core idea underlying abduction; the \nsecond is not quite as general, but it is still meant to undermine a \nbroad class of candidate explications of abduction. Both objections \nare due to Bas van Fraassen. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe first objection has as a premise that it is part of the meaning \nof “explanation” that if one theory is more explanatory \nthan another, the former must be more informative than the latter \n(see, e.g., van Fraassen 1983, Sect. 2). The alleged problem then is\nthat it is “an elementary logical point that a more informative\ntheory cannot be more likely to be true [and thus] attempts to \ndescribe inductive or evidential support through features that \nrequire information (such as ‘Inference to the Best \nExplanation’) must either contradict themselves or \nequivocate” (van Fraassen 1989, 192). The elementary logical \npoint is supposed to be “most [obvious] … in the \nparadigm case in which one theory is an extension of another: clearly\nthe extension has more ways of being false” (van Fraassen\n1985, 280). </p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt is important to note, however, that in any other kind of case than\nthe “paradigm” one, the putative elementary point is not \nobvious at all. For instance, it is entirely unclear in what sense \nSpecial Relativity Theory “has more ways of being false” \nthan Lorentz's version of the æther theory, given that \nthey make the same predictions. And yet the former is generally \nregarded as being superior, <em>qua</em> explanation, to the latter. \n(If van Fraassen were to object that the former is not really more \ninformative than the latter, or at any rate not more informative in \nthe appropriate sense—whatever that is—then we should \ncertainly refuse to grant the premise that in order to be more \nexplanatory a theory must be more informative.) </p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe second objection, proffered in van Fraassen 1989 (Ch. 6), is \nlevelled at probabilistic versions of abduction. The objection is \nthat such rules must either amount to Bayes' rule, and thus be \nredundant, or be at variance with it but then, on the grounds of \nLewis' dynamic Dutch book argument (as reported in Teller\n1973), be probabilistically incoherent, meaning that they may lead \none to assess as fair a number of bets which together ensure a \nfinancial loss, come what may; and, van Fraassen argues, it would be \nirrational to follow a rule that has this feature. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nHowever, this objection fares no better than the first. For one \nthing, as Patrick Maher (1992) and Brian Skyrms (1993) have pointed \nout, a loss in one respect may be outweighed by a benefit in another.\nIt might be, for instance, that some probabilistic version of \nabduction does much better, at least in our world, than Bayes' \nrule, in that, on average, it approaches the truth faster in the \nsense that it is faster in assigning a high probability (understood \nas probability above a certain threshold value) to the true \nhypothesis. If it does, then following that rule instead of \nBayes' rule may have advantages which perhaps are not so \nreadily expressed in terms of money yet which should arguably be \ntaken into account when deciding which rule to go by. It is, in \nshort, not so clear whether following a probabilistically incoherent \nrule must be irrational. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nFor another thing, Igor Douven (1999) argues that the question of \nwhether a probabilistic rule is coherent is not one that can be \nsettled independently of considering which other epistemic and \ndecision-theoretic rules are deployed along with it; coherence should\nbe understood as a property of packages of both epistemic and \ndecision-theoretic rules, not of epistemic rules (such as \nprobabilistic rules for belief change) in isolation. In the same \npaper, a coherent package of rules is described which includes a \nprobabilistic version of abduction. (See Kvanvig 1994, Harman 1997,\nLeplin 1997, Niiniluoto 1999, and Okasha 2000, for different \nresponses to van Fraassen's critique of probabilistic versions \nof abduction.) </p>\n\n<h3><a name=\"Def\">3.2 Defenses</a></h3>\n\n<p>\n\nHardly anyone nowadays would want to subscribe to a conception of \ntruth that posits a necessary connection between explanatory force \nand truth—for instance, because it stipulates explanatory \nsuperiority to be necessary for truth. As a result, a priori defenses\nof abduction seem out of the question. Indeed, all defenses that have\nbeen given so far are of an empirical nature in that they appeal to \ndata that supposedly support the claim that (in some form) abduction \nis a reliable rule of inference. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe best-known argument of this sort was developed by Richard Boyd in\nthe 1980s (see Boyd 1981, 1984, 1985). It starts by underlining the \ntheory-dependency of scientific methodology, which comprises methods \nfor designing experiments, for assessing data, for choosing between \nrival hypotheses, and so on. For instance, in considering possible \nconfounding factors from which an experimental setup has to be \nshielded, scientists draw heavily on already accepted theories. The \nargument next calls attention to the apparent reliability of this \nmethodology, which, after all, has yielded, and continues to yield, \nimpressively accurate theories. In particular, by relying on this \nmethodology, scientists have for some time now been able to find ever\nmore instrumentally adequate theories. Boyd then argues that the \nreliability of scientific methodology is best explained by assuming \nthat the theories on which it relies are at least approximately true.\nFrom this and from the fact that these theories were mostly arrived \nat by abductive reasoning, he concludes that abduction must be a \nreliable rule of inference. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nCritics have accused this argument of being circular. Specifically, \nit has been said that the argument rests on a premise—that \nscientific methodology is informed by approximately true background \ntheories—which in turn rests on an inference to the best \nexplanation for its plausibility. And the reliability of this type of\ninference is precisely what is at stake. (See, for instance, Laudan \n1981 and Fine 1984.) </p>\n\n<p>\n\nTo this, Stathis Psillos (1999, Ch. 4) has responded by invoking a \ndistinction credited to Richard Braithwaite, to wit, the distinction \nbetween premise-circularity and rule-circularity. An argument is \npremise-circular if its conclusion is amongst its premises. A \nrule-circular argument, by contrast, is an argument of which the \nconclusion asserts something about an inferential rule that is used \nin the very same argument. As Psillos urges, Boyd's argument is\nrule-circular, but not premise-circular, and rule-circular arguments,\nPsillos contends, <em>need not</em> be viciously circular (even \nthough a premise-circular argument is always viciously circular). To \nbe more precise, in his view, an argument for the reliability of a \ngiven rule <i>R</i> that essentially relies on <i>R</i> as an \ninferential principle is not vicious, provided that the use of \n<i>R</i> does not guarantee a positive conclusion about \n<i>R</i>'s reliability. Psillos claims that in Boyd's \nargument, this proviso is met. For while Boyd concludes that the \nbackground theories on which scientific methodology relies are \napproximately true on the basis of an abductive step, the use of \nabduction itself does not guarantee the truth of his conclusion. \nAfter all, granting the use of abduction does nothing to ensure that \nthe best explanation of the success of scientific methodology is the \napproximate truth of the relevant background theories. Thus, Psillos \nconcludes, Boyd's argument still stands. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nEven if the use of abduction in Boyd's argument might have led \nto the conclusion that abduction is <em>not</em> reliable, one may \nstill have worries about the argument's being rule-circular. \nFor suppose that some scientific community relied not on abduction \nbut on a rule that we may dub “Inference to the Worst \nExplanation” (IWE), a rule that sanctions inferring to the \n<em>worst</em> explanation of the available data. We may safely \nassume that the use of this rule mostly would lead to the adoption of\nvery unsuccessful theories. Nevertheless, the said community might \njustify its use of IWE by dint of the following reasoning: \n“Scientific theories tend to be hugely unsuccessful. These \ntheories were arrived at by application of IWE. That IWE is a \nreliable rule of inference—that is, a rule of inference mostly \nleading from true premises to true conclusions—is surely the \nworst explanation of the fact that our theories are so unsuccessful. \nHence, by application of IWE, we may conclude that IWE is a reliable \nrule of inference.” While this would be an utterly absurd \nconclusion, the argument leading up to it cannot be convicted of \nbeing viciously circular anymore than Boyd's argument for the \nreliability of abduction can (if Psillos is right). It would appear, \nthen, that there must be something else amiss with rule-circularity. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt is fair to note that for Psillos, the fact that a rule-circular \nargument does not guarantee a positive conclusion about the rule at \nissue is not sufficient for such an argument to be valid. A further \nnecessary condition is “that one should not have reason to \ndoubt the reliability of the rule—that there is nothing \ncurrently available which can make one distrust the rule” \n(Psillos 1999, 85). And there is plenty of reason to doubt the \nreliability of IWE; in fact, the above argument <em>supposes \n</em>that it is unreliable. Two questions arise, however. First, why \nshould we accept the additional condition? Second, do we really have \n<em>no</em> reason to doubt the reliability of abduction? Certainly \n<em>some</em> of the abductive inferences we make lead us to accept \n<em>falsehoods</em>. How many falsehoods may we accept on the basis \nof abduction before we can legitimately begin to distrust this rule? \nNo clear answers have been given to these questions. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nBe this as it may, even if rule-circularity is neither vicious nor \notherwise problematic, one may still wonder how Boyd's argument\nis to convert a critic of abduction, given that it relies on \nabduction. But Psillos makes it clear that the point of philosophical\nargumentation is not always, and in any case need not be, to convince\nan opponent of one's position. Sometimes the point is, more \nmodestly, to assure or reassure oneself that the position one \nendorses, or is tempted to endorse, is correct. In the case at hand, \nwe need not think of Boyd's argument as an attempt to convince \nthe opponent of abduction of its reliability. Rather, it may be \nthought of as justifying the rule from within the perspective of \nsomeone who is already sympathetic towards abduction; see Psillos \n1999 (89). </p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere have also been attempts to argue for abduction in a more \nstraightforward fashion, to wit, via enumerative induction. The \ncommon idea of these attempts is that every newly recorded successful\napplication of abduction—like the discovery of Neptune, whose \nexistence had been postulated on explanatory grounds (see Section \n1.2)—adds further support to the hypothesis that abduction is a\nreliable rule of inference, in the way in which every newly observed \nblack raven adds some support to the hypothesis that all ravens are \nblack. Because it does not involve abductive reasoning, this type of \nargument is more likely to also appeal to disbelievers in abduction. \nSee Harré 1986, 1988, Bird 1998 (160), Kitcher 2001, \nand Douven 2002 for suggestions along these lines. </p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"AbdVerBayConThe\">4. Abduction versus Bayesian Confirmation Theory</a></h2>\n\n<p>\n\nIn the past decade, Bayesian confirmation theory has firmly \nestablished itself as the dominant view on confirmation; currently \none cannot very well discuss a confirmation-theoretic issue without \nmaking clear whether, and if so why, one's position on that \nissue deviates from standard Bayesian thinking. Abduction, in \nwhichever version, assigns a confirmation-theoretic role to \nexplanation: explanatory considerations contribute to making some \nhypotheses more credible, and others less so. By contrast, Bayesian \nconfirmation theory makes no reference at all to the concept of \nexplanation. Does this imply that abduction is at loggerheads with \nthe prevailing doctrine in confirmation theory? Several authors have \nrecently argued that not only is abduction compatible with \nBayesianism, it is a much-needed supplement to it. The so far fullest\ndefense of this view has been given by Lipton (2004, Ch. 7); as he \nputs it, Bayesians should also be “explanationists” (his \nname for the advocates of abduction). (For other defenses, see \nOkasha 2000, McGrew 2003, and Weisberg 2009.) </p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis requires some clarification. For what could it mean for a \nBayesian to be an explanationist? In order to apply Bayes' rule\nand determine the probability for <i>H</i> after learning <i>E</i>, \nthe Bayesian agent will have to determine the probability of <i>H</i>\nconditional on <i>E</i>. For that, he needs to assign unconditional \nprobabilities to <i>H</i> and <i>E</i> as well as a probability to \n<i>E</i> given <i>H</i>; the former two are mostly called \n“prior probabilities” (or just “priors”) of, \nrespectively, <i>H</i> and <i>E</i>, the latter the \n“likelihood” of <i>H</i> on <i>E</i>. (This is the \nofficial Bayesian story. Not all of those who sympathize with \nBayesianism adhere to that story. For instance, according to some it \nis more reasonable to think that conditional probabilities are basic \nand that we derive unconditional probabilities from them; see \nHájek 2003, and references therein.) How is the Bayesian to \ndetermine these values? As is well known, probability theory gives us\nmore probabilities once we have some; it does not give us \nprobabilities from scratch. Of course, when <i>H</i> implies <i>E</i>\nor the negation of <i>E</i>, or when <i>H</i> is a statistical \nhypothesis that bestows a certain chance on <i>E</i>, then the \nlikelihood follows “analytically.” (This claim assumes \nsome version of Lewis' (1980) Principal Principle, and it is \ncontroversial whether or not this principle is analytic; hence the \nscare quotes.) But this is not always the case, and even if it were, \nthere would still be the question of how to determine the priors. \nThis is where, according to Lipton, abduction comes in. In his \nproposal, Bayesians ought to determine their prior probabilities and,\nif applicable, likelihoods on the basis of explanatory \nconsiderations. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nExactly how are explanatory considerations to guide one's \nchoice of priors? The answer to this question is not as simple as one\nmight at first think. Suppose you are considering what priors to \nassign to a collection of rival hypotheses and you wish to follow \nLipton's suggestion. How are you to do this? An \nobvious—though still somewhat vague—answer may seem to go\nlike this: Whatever exact priors you are going to assign, you should \nassign a higher one to the hypothesis that explains the available \ndata best than to any of its rivals (provided there is a best \nexplanation). Note, though, that your neighbor, who is a Bayesian but\nthinks confirmation has nothing to do with explanation, may well \nassign a prior to the best explanation that is even higher than the \none you assign to that hypothesis. In fact, his priors for best \nexplanations may even be consistently higher than yours, not because \nin his view explanation is somehow related to confirmation—it \nis not, he thinks—but, well, just because. In this context, \n“just because” is a perfectly legitimate reason, because \nany reason for fixing one's priors counts as legitimate by \nBayesian standards. According to mainstream Bayesian epistemology, \npriors (and sometimes likelihoods) are up for grabs, meaning that one\nassignment of priors is as good as another, provided both are \ncoherent (that is, they obey the axioms of probability theory). \nLipton's recommendation to the Bayesian to be an explanationist\nis meant to be entirely general. But what should your neighbor do \ndifferently if he wants to follow the recommendation? Should he give \nthe same prior to any best explanation that you, his explanationist \nneighbor, give to it, that is, <em>lower</em> his priors for best \nexplanations? Or rather should he give even <em>higher</em> priors to\nbest explanations than those he already gives? </p>\n\n<p>\n\nPerhaps Lipton's proposal is not intended to address those who \nalready assign highest priors to best explanations, even if they do \nso on grounds that have nothing to do with explanation. The idea \nmight be that, as long as one does assign highest priors to those \nhypotheses, everything is fine, or at least finer than if one does \nnot do so, regardless of one's reasons for assigning those \npriors. The answer to the question of how explanatory considerations \nare to guide one's choice of priors would then presumably be \nthat one ought to assign a higher prior to the best explanation than \nto its rivals, if this is not what one already does. If it is, one \nshould just keep doing what one is doing. </p>\n\n<p>\n\n(As an aside, it should be noticed that, according to standard \nBayesian usage, the term “priors” does not necessarily \nrefer to the degrees of belief a person assigns before the receipt of\n<em>any</em> data. If there are already data in, then, clearly, one \nmay assign higher priors to hypotheses that best explain the \nthen-available data. However, one can sensibly speak of “best \nexplanations” even before any data are known. For example, one \nhypothesis may be judged to be a better explanation than any of its \nrivals because the former requires less complicated mathematics, or \nbecause it is stated in terms of familiar concepts only, which is not\ntrue of the others. More generally, such judgments may be based on \nwhat Kosso (1992, 30) calls <em>internal features</em> of hypotheses \nor theories, that is, features that “can be evaluated without \nhaving to observe the world.”) </p>\n\n<p>\n\nA more interesting answer to the above question of how explanation is\nto guide one's choice of priors has been given by Jonathan \nWeisberg (2009). We said that mainstream Bayesians regard one \nassignment of prior probabilities as being as good as any other. \nSo-called objective Bayesians do not do so, however. These Bayesians \nthink priors must obey principles beyond the probability axioms in \norder to be admissible. Objective Bayesians are divided among \nthemselves over exactly which further principles are to be obeyed, \nbut at least for a while they agreed that the Principle of \nIndifference is among them. Roughly stated, this principle counsels \nthat, absent a reason to the contrary, we give equal priors to \ncompeting hypotheses. As is well known, however, in its original form\nthe Principle of Indifference may lead to inconsistent assignments of\nprobabilities and so can hardly be advertised as a principle of \nrationality. The problem is that there are typically various ways to \npartition logical space that appear plausible given the problem at \nhand, and that not all of them lead to the same prior probability \nassignment, even assuming the Principle of Indifference. \nWeisberg's proposal amounts to the claim that explanatory \nconsiderations may favor some of those partitions over others. \nPerhaps we will not always end up with a unique partition to which \nthe Principle of Indifference is to be applied, but it would already \nbe progress if we ended up with only a handful of partitions. For we \ncould then still arrive in a motivated way at our prior \nprobabilities, by proceeding in two steps, namely, by first applying \nthe Principle of Indifference to the partitions separately, thereby \npossibly obtaining different assignments of priors, and by then \ntaking a weighted average of the thus obtained priors, where the \nweights, too, are to depend on explanatory considerations. The result\nwould again be a probability function—the uniquely correct \nprior probability function, according to Weisberg. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe proposal is intriguing as far as it goes but, as Weisberg admits,\nin its current form, it does not go very far. For one thing, it is \nunclear how exactly explanatory considerations are to determine the \nweights required for the second step of the proposal. For another, it\nmay be idle to hope that taking explanatory considerations into \naccount will in general leave us with a manageable set of partitions,\nor that, even if it does, this will not be due merely to the fact \nthat we are overlooking a great many prima facie plausible ways of \npartitioning logical space to begin with. (The latter point echoes \nthe argument of the bad lot, of course.) </p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnother suggestion about the connection between abduction and \nBayesian reasoning—to be found in Okasha 2000, McGrew 2003,\nand Lipton 2004 (Ch. 7)—is that the explanatory considerations\nmay serve as a heuristic to determine, even if only roughly, priors \nand likelihoods in cases in which we would otherwise be clueless and \ncould do no better than guessing. This suggestion is sensitive to the\nwell-recognized fact that we are not always able to assign a prior to\nevery hypothesis of interest, or to say how probable a given piece of\nevidence is conditional on a given hypothesis. Consideration of that \nhypothesis' explanatory power might then help us to figure out,\nif perhaps only within certain bounds, what prior to assign to it, or\nwhat likelihood to assign to it on the given evidence. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nBayesians, especially the more modest ones, might want to retort that\nthe Bayesian procedure is to be followed if, and only if, either (a) \npriors and likelihoods can be determined with some precision and \nobjectivity, or (b) likelihoods can be determined with some precision\nand priors can be expected to “wash out” as more and more\nevidence accumulates, or (c) priors and likelihoods can both be \nexpected to wash out. In the remaining cases—they might \nsay—we should simply refrain from applying Bayesian reasoning. \nA fortiori, then, there is no need for an abduction-enhanced \nBayesianism in these cases. And some incontrovertible mathematical \nresults indicate that, in the cases that fall under (a), (b), or (c),\nour probabilities will converge to the truth anyhow. Consequently, in\nthose cases there is no need for the kind of abductive heuristics \nthat the above-mentioned authors suggest, either. (Weisberg 2009, \nSect. 3.2, raises similar concerns.) </p>\n\n<p>\n\nPsillos (2000) proposes yet another way in which abduction might \nsupplement Bayesian confirmation theory, one that is very much in the\nspirit of Peirce's conception of abduction. The idea is that \nabduction may assist us in selecting plausible candidates for \ntesting, where the actual testing then is to follow Bayesian lines. \nHowever, Psillos concedes (2004) that this proposal assigns a\nrole to abduction that will strike committed explanationists as being\ntoo limited. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nFinally, a possibility that has so far not been considered in the \nliterature is that abduction and Bayesianism do not so much work in \ntandem—as they do on the above proposals—as operate in \ndifferent modes of reasoning; the Bayesian and the explanationist are\ncharacters that feature in different plays, so to speak. It is widely\naccepted that sometimes we speak and think about our beliefs in a \ncategorical manner, while at other times we speak and think about \nthem in a graded way. It is far from clear how these different ways \nof speaking and thinking about beliefs—the epistemology of \nbelief and the epistemology of degrees of belief, to use Richard \nFoley's (1992) terminology—are related to one another. In\nfact, it is an open question whether there is any straightforward \nconnection between the two, or even whether there is a connection at \nall. Be that as it may, given that the distinction is undeniable, it \nis a plausible suggestion that, just as there are different ways of \ntalking and thinking about beliefs, there are different ways of \ntalking and thinking about the <em>revision</em> of beliefs. In \nparticular, abduction could well have its home in the epistemology of\nbelief, and be called upon whenever we reason about our beliefs in a \ncategorical mode, while at the same time Bayes' rule could have\nits home in the epistemology of degrees of belief. Hard-nosed \nBayesians may insist that whatever reasoning goes on in the \ncategorical mode must eventually be justifiable in Bayesian terms, \nbut this presupposes the existence of bridge principles connecting \nthe epistemology of belief with the epistemology of degrees of \nbelief—and, as mentioned, whether such principles exist is \npresently unclear. </p>\n\n</div><div id=\"article-copyright\">\n    <p>\n <a href=\"../../info.html#c\">Copyright © 2011</a> by\n\n<br />\nIgor Douven\n&lt;<a href=\"mailto:i%2ee%2ej%2edouven%40rug%2enl\"><em>i<abbr title=\" dot \">.</abbr>e<abbr title=\" dot \">.</abbr>j<abbr title=\" dot \">.</abbr>douven<abbr title=\" at \">@</abbr>rug<abbr title=\" dot \">.</abbr>nl</em></a>&gt;\n    </p>\n  </div><div id=\"bibliography\">\n\n<h2><a name=\"Bib\">Bibliography</a></h2>\n\n<ul class=\"hanging\">\n\n<li>Achinstein, P., 2001. <em>The Book of Evidence</em>, Oxford:\nOxford University Press.</li>\n\n<li>Adler, J., 1994. “Testimony, Trust,\nKnowing,” <em>Journal of Philosophy</em>, 91: 264–275.</li>\n\n<li>Bach, K. and Harnish, R., 1979. <em>Linguistic Communication and\nSpeech Acts</em>, Cambridge MA: MIT Press.</li>\n\n<li>Bird, A., 1998. <em>Philosophy of Science</em>, London: UCL\nPress.</li>\n\n<li>Bovens, L. and Hartmann, S., 2003. “Solving the Riddle of\nCoherence,” <em>Mind</em>, 112: 601–633.</li>\n\n<li>Boyd, R., 1981. “Scientific Realism and Naturalistic\nEpistemology,” in P.
